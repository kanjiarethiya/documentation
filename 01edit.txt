After completing installation, open it
On opening the application a screen will appear with 3 different options to select
Click on create new repository 
Enter the name of the repository
In description, enter details about the project for which you want to create a repository
Enter the location where you wish to save the git file of repository(Example: local disk C > Final git)
Untick 'initialize this repository with a README'
Click on Create Repository.
A file will be created in the folder(final git) which you had selected while creating repository
In that same folder(final git), copy the document for which you are creating the Repository(Example: git documentation.txt)
As soon as the folder is added, it will appear in the github application.
now open the github application.
here you can see changes column, saying about the addition of new folder(final documentation.txt)
now yo need to approve the changes by commiting it
So at bottom of the screen there is summery option
in which you need to add details(Example: new folder for documentation created) about new folder and then click on commit to master.
As we click on commit to master, the file gets saved in repository.

Now we need to upload this file online on github.com
Open github.com
Create an account using the email-id
As the account is created, go back to github application
In the application sign in with the acccount by clicking on options in the file menu at the top.
So now the github desktop application is in sync with github.com
In github application the current repository will be the repository on which you are working
So next to that there will be an option 'Publish Repository'
click on Publish repository 
after clicking on it a popup box will appear
it will show the name of repository
Untick 'keep this code private' (you will need to subscribe to keep the code private)
After that click on 'Publish repository'
now the file has been uploaded to github by your account
now sign in into account by which the file had been uploaded
After signing in go to your repository option
it will show all the changes made and commited by the desktop application
 
So all you need to do is after making any change in the file, open the github application, commit all the changes to master and then publish it to online github account.


Branching
Branching is to keep the original file safe
now if you need to do any changes in the original file(documentation)
it will be lways better to create a branch and then work in the branch
so now any changes you make will be done in the branch keeping master(documentaton) at safe side

to create a branch open the application
after opening the application in the centre  top there will be an option showing about the current branch
at present it will be showing current branc has master
click on that option
a box will appear with 'filter' written in it
so clickon that option 
after clicking you will need to enter the name of the branch(documentation01)
then click on Create new branch.
